zdOS lab's was born from the passion of getting by and the blockchain ecosystem.
The main purpose of zdOS is to be able to create the first "operating system-dapp" by merging Kalinet OS and D$N token. 
the idea of ​​this structure is to bring people to an educational purpose and a free computer system. zdOS has one and only founder and one employee and this will make creation a little faster. I ask you interested to contact me and zdOS and predisposed to the collaboration of all of you

Kalinet OS is a z80 kernel and a collection of programs, tools and documentation that allows you to assemble an OS that, when completed, will be able to:

Run on minimal and improvised machines.
Interface through improvised means (serial, keyboard, display).
Edit text files.
Compile assembler source files for a wide range of MCUs and CPUs.
Read and write from a wide range of storage devices.
Replicate itself.
Additionally, the goal of this project is to be as self-contained as possible. With a copy of this project, a capable and creative person should be able to manage to build and install Collapse OS without external resources (i.e. internet) on a machine of her design, built from scavenged parts with low-tech tools.

Organisation of this repository

- kernel: Pieces of code to be assembled by the user into a kernel.
- apps: Pieces of code to be assembled into "userspace" application.
- recipes: collection of recipes that assemble parts together on a specific machine.
- doc: User guide for when you've successfully installed Collapse OS.
-tools: Tools for working with Kalinet OS from "modern" environments. Mostly development tools, but also contains emulated zasm, which is necessary to build Kalinet OS from a non-Kalinet OS machine.
Each folder has a README with more details.

Status
The project unfinished but is progressing well! See [kalinet.site OS' website][web] for more information.

work in progress! .
